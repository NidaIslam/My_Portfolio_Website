# My_Portfolio_Website
Hi, I am Nida Islam A passionate Frontend Developer from Pakistan. 
I developed my Portfolio Website using HTML, CSS and type.js as Javascript. As I want to make my personal website which everyone can view to get to know about my skillsets and work experience during my academic years. I am new to github and learning to use this platform like professionals, also to bring productivity in my work.
In future, I can add more feature in this website to write the blog post and also to showcase my portfolio in more presentable way while sharing my work experiences.

If you are interested to view my work, so you have to download the file on your PC and open this downloaded code files in VS Code, then run live server it will open the website on your local server (Do not forget to install live server if you do not have already).

I also write articles on medium, you can follow me here: https://medium.com/@nidah.chaudary

# My_Portfolio_Website
## Hi, I am Nida Islam. A passionate Frontend Developer from Pakistan. 
I developed a Responsive Portfolio Website using HTML, CSS and type.js as Javascript. As I want to make my personal website that everyone can view to know about my skillsets and work experience that I have done during my academic years. I am new to github(a version control system) and learning to use this platform to bring more productivity in my work.

In future, I would add more feature in this website to write the blog post and also to showcase my portfolio in more presentable way while sharing my updated work experiences.

If you are interested to view my work, so you have to download the files on your PC and open the downloaded code files in VS Code, then run live server it will open the website on your local server (Do not forget to install live server if you do not have already).

###### I also write articles on medium, you can follow me here: https://medium.com/@nidah.chaudary.
I hope this readme file is helpful for you to know about my project.
